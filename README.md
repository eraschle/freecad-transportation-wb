# freecad-transportation-wb
Python transportation workbench for FreeCAD

This workbench is being developed to provide functionality specific to transportation engineering (road and rail).

Clone the project into the .FreeCAD/Mod/Transportation folder to use.

Note:  This project has a dependency in another FreeCAD workbench, microelly2's Nurbs Workbench.  A symlink exists in which pionts to it in the Transportation source.  

You can satisfy this dependency one of two ways:

1. Clone the Nurbs workbench into .FreeCAD/Mod/nurbs folder
2. Delete the symlink and copy the freecad-nurbs/sketcher/feedbacksketch.py file to the Transportation folder.

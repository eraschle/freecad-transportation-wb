# Import Data into a project

The simplest way to get some real data into the project is
the use of the geodat workbench to import openstreetmap data.

For testing purposes there are 3 location in the Demo menu.
Eichleite is a street with strong curves and a height difference of near 100 meters.
It is an interesting real testcase for swept paths. The street is forbidden for long vehicles.

After calling the methods some groups are created. The GRP paths contains all paths found,
the GRP highways contains street objects.
The center of the area square is the origin and corresponds to the lat long values used in the scripts.

For other locations use the geodat workbench's "Import OSM Map".
